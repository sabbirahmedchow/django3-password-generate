# django3-password-generate

This is a simple password generator app build on django 3.10.

How to deplay:

1. Open a terminal and browse to the folder where you have downloaded the project.

2. Write this command in your terminal to start the server:
     python manage.py runserver

N.B. If you are running python verion 3.x, then write python3 instead of python(based on your compiler version).

3. The project will run on 127.0.0.1:8080 but if your 8080 port is not avaiable, then try run the server on different port. For example:
     python3 manage.py runserver 8081 (This will run the server on port 8081)
